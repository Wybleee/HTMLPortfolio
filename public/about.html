<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Zakk Bonham and I am currently attending Angelina College to get my associates in general studies. I plan on transferring to a four-year university to get my bachelors' in computer science. I want to work in cybersecurity but in the meantime, I would like to work in web development. I hope this portfolio proves that I am a great choice for your team.
